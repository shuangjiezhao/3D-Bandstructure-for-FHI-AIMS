# 3D-Bandstructure-for-FHI-AIMS
This repository contains scripts to generate and visualize 3D band structure data from FHI-AIMS simulations, particularly suited for large supercells (e.g., graphene + COF systems). The scripts automate k-point mesh creation, data extraction from FHI-AIMS output files, and visual representation of band structures.
